            Pussyfete - Black Cat - Empathy
            Although Pussyfete sounds like a sex party, it is not.  This annual Woman’s Month Pussyfete aka Kittyfete is an opportunity to explore and celebrate the divine feminine in each of us and around us.  What better way to honor feminine energy other than by using the age old symbol of a cat.   A portion of your entry fee to this cat themed party will go to an organization that supports women.  So, if you love, respect and cherish women and cats this event is for you. 
            Semfete - Black Ant - Empowerment
            The word Summer stems from the variant of the Proto-Indo-European sem meaning “together/one”. Semfete is an annual Summer party (Summerfete) that represents the idea that the  community and the individual are dependent on each other for success. 
            The event themes will represent the many types of communities in our world such as a jungle, ocean, farm and more. Like our neighborhoods, each of these animal communities share many characteristics. Semfete is the opportunity for people who share a neighborhood and often times commonalities, to do community service during the day for their beloved area and at night party for their community. By the end of Semfete, there will be an established togetherness and oneness. A portion of a person’s entry fee to the night party will be donated to a community center or non-profit in support of a specific neighborhood.
            Consciousfete - Ladybug - Exploration
            Consciousness is about having knowledge and being aware. This event is tied to an emerging conference that allows individuals to explore space, science, the arts, and all things unknown and forgotten. At night, participants will have access to the space themed night party Consciousfete. Since art is a great representation of consciousness,  the expression of human’s creativity and experiences, a portion of each guest’s entry fee will be donated to a non-profit that supports the arts.
            Spiritfete - Red Snake - Wholeness
            
            A festival that allows you to come as you are. Wear what you feel like as long as it is not hateful.  So get creative! Explore your shadow side as well as your tribal side. There is no judgement. This is the place you go to release your darkest secrets and begin your healing process in a space of love, empathy and hope. Let your spirit free. At night, there will be a party honoring the spirit - YOU.
